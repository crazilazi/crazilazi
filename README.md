- 👋 Behold, the paradoxical concoction of my existence: 💻 A full-stack developer entrenched in the structured realm of Web2, yet enraptured by the limitless horizons of Web3. 🌐 Lazy by nature, yet fueled by a relentless passion for innovation and the eccentricity it brings. I am the curious enigma, balancing the inertia of my tendencies with the boundless energy of a tech enthusiast exploring uncharted territories. 🚀✨
- 👀     I love JavaScript, coz it makes you happy most of the time. 
          I like creating magic using c#, JavaScript, angular, react, azure, events.
- 🌱      Currently learning solidity, NextJs.
